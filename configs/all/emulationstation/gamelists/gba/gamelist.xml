		<desc>No one has ever been able to say just why Bubble Bobble is so much fun, but its mixture of cute baby dinosaurs, candy, and bubbles should give those new to the game an idea. Battle your way through over 100 levels of frantic bubble mayhem. Capture your enemies in bubbles then pop them with your spiky back to clear each stage. Find your way to the bottom of the 100-level cave and save a damsel in distress. Fortunately, if you've never experienced the glee for yourself, all of those elements are back in force in Bubble Bobble Old &amp; New for Game Boy Advance. The game closely follows the original Bubble Bobble arcade classic, but splices together two gaming generations while employing the same graphics and gameplay structure as the original. It also took inspiration from the sequel, Rainbow Islands released in 1989.</desc>

Rool hadn't stolen the special medallion meant for the winner. Donkey Kong and his friends must swing their way through the jungle to get the medallion back and, along the way, rescue Diddy, Dixie, and Funky Kong from King K. Rool's minions. A unique control system lets you swing through the trees and spin to build up momentum for a mighty leap. Innovative level design combines elements of platform and puzzle games: Grab gears and spin to crank doors open. Watch out for bolts that loosen as you spin, or you might find yourself falling flat. You'll need steady hands to make the leap-of-faith that takes you to the treetops.</desc>

		<name>Earthworm Jim</name>
		<desc>The storyline involves many colorful characters. Jim (voiced by TenNapel) was at first an ordinary earthworm who did very earthworm-like things such as flee from crows and eat dirt. One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an "Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit" built by Professor Monkey-for-a-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim. By a stroke of luck, Jim managed to land within the collar of the suit, and it ended up mutating him into the large and intelligent (at least by earthworm standards) superhero he is today.</desc>

		<desc>Midway brings back all the craziness of the Cartoon Network's ED, EDD, N EDDY with ED, EDD, N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES for the Game Boy Advance. Centering around three kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On one level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice from other characters. There are several different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or steal. Gamers who love ED, EDD, N EDDY will love stepping into the characters' shoes with ED EDD N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES.</desc>

The lobby and areas between floors are white with flower-themed decorations, but each floor can be transformed into a different world from the first Kingdom Hearts game using "world cards" created from Sora's memories. Like before, many of the worlds are based on Disney films while the rest were created by Square Enix.

Unlike the previous game, the worlds are created from Sora's memories. As such, many of the events experienced in Kingdom Hearts are relived in this game; Sora encounters memory-based versions of Disney characters that he has met before. The individual plotlines differ from those in the original game and revolve around the theme of memory. The exception is the Deep Jungle world which does not reappear in Chain of Memories. Just as Kingdom Hearts had several worlds created specifically for that game, Chain of Memories introduces Twilight Town, in addition to the original worlds of Kingdom Hearts. The world card for Twilight Town was created from memories on "the other side of Sora's heart".</desc>

Each phrase entered will create a unique monster, which will always appear when that specific phrase is entered. Players can experiment with many different phrases for unexpected results. Two separate monsters can also be combined with special items to form an entirely new monster. Certain combinations will lead to hidden, rare monsters which can not be obtained through the normal monster generation process.

The Coaching System from Monster Rancher Advance has been dramatically improved for added depth in the sequel. Depending on the monster type, certain coaches will offer unique training sessions which other monster coaches will not be able to provide. These special training sessions can be very difficult and dangerous, yet have potential to yield major results. A monster's charisma and skills will also be crucial factors in deciding whether it is suitable to be a good coach or not. Coaches will now recognize and alert you to certain warnings which your breeding assistant may not notice.</desc>

It is the first handheld Rayman game to feature multiplayer modes which made use of the Game Boy Advance/GameCube link cable, to link to the GameCube version. It is a 2D side-scrolling game with elements from Rayman, Rayman 2, and Rayman 3, though it is mostly centered around the story of Rayman 2. It is thought that it was originally developed as a Game Boy Advance version of Rayman 2, and that its Rayman 3 elements were added late in its development so that it could be marketed as a Game Boy Advance version of Rayman 3.</desc>

		<desc>In the Professor's lab, The Professor shows Spyro and Sparx his two new inventions. The first is a projector-like peephole machine, enabling them to spy on Ripto. The Professor then displays his next new invention - Butler, a large mechanical bear designed to help him in his lab. Unfortunately Butler malfunctions and the Professor has failed to equip it with an "off" switch. Spyro manages to short Butler out by luring him into a power generator, then the peephole machine malfunctions and the hole in the fabric of space begins to expand rapidly.
A terrified Professor tells Spyro about "Hearts" - magical objects with very special properties and the only way to control the problem. The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands. Ripto warps out Spyro along with Sparx and Butler to the Dragon Shores.
After Spyro is able to travel back to the Professor's Lab and travel through the peephole's vortex to Rypto's Chateau, he finds Ripto about to lower the Professor into a pit of lava, but engages in combat with Spyro. After being defeated, Ripto captures him and Sparx. Butler reappears, and the Professor orders him to trap Ripto. Ripto, now incapacitated, yields the final heart and the Professor permanently seals the hole in space.

RPG elements offer more depth than previous Spyro titles, including quests, mini-quests, and a new inventory system, creating more ways to enjoy the Dragon Realms and making this a completely new Spyro experience.</desc>

They have always had to worry about dragon slayers, plus they usually get a bad rap for being destructive, and let's not even get started on what people say about their breath! Fortunately Spyro has generally avoided such negative opinions, but then again he hasn't always had it easy either. You'd think that after several death-defying adventures on the Playstation over the past few years, which included the defeat of the evil Sorceress, Spyro and his friends would be able to take some time off and enjoy a bit of a vacation at Dragon Shores. But with evil brewing and a new title on the way for the GameBoy Advance, which is due out in November, the gang shouldn't get too comfortable on the beach.</desc>

Summon Night: Swordcraft Story progresses through the story on a day-by-day basis. The entire game consists of 10 days, where the player traverses through the town of Wystern and the Labyrinth Dungeon. Each day, more levels of the Labyrinth are unlocked and the player is required to travel deeper to complete mandatory quests. A day normally ends after a tournament or boss battle.

Baby-sitting a whiny newborn is about as fun as a head cold on the first day of summer vacation. But when Baby Mario falls from the sky, the Yoshis seize the opportunity to do a lot more than change diapers.

The big-hearted Yoshis vow to reunite Baby Mario with his twin brother on the far side of the island. It won't be easy, but the Yoshis are determined to take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.

Brilliant game-designer Shigeru Miyamoto has crammed the island's jungles, caves and snowcapped peaks with one brain-bending surprise after another. Hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses and all-new pals await your discovery.

Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower. He can jump, hover, stomp, pound the ground and slurp up enemies. Best of all, he can throw eggs. Heck, Mario even gets to presto-chango into superfast Superstar Mario, while Yoshi morphs into a toy submarine that shoots itty-bitty torpedoes.

As an added bonus, Yoshi's Island includes six super-challenging levels developed just for the GBA. You can also take a break from baby-sitting duties to indulge in multiplayer Mario Bros. action.

In Super Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, the unlikely duo of Yoshi and Baby Mario must together brave a world of infinite surprise and challenge. Richly varied gameplay, brilliant graphics and precision control perfectly meld in an adventure you won't be able to put down!</desc>

Lara's character model features natural structure, realistic textures, detailed facial features, reactive eyes and fluid motion, all of which make her part of a living environment. New character animations and controls allow her to move through stunning environments with grace and precision, while an understanding of the game's original appeal reinvigorates the fundamental explore-and-solve adventure experience.</desc>

		<name>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Prophecy</name>
		<desc>Lara Croft discovers a manuscript which speaks of a mysterious occult magic which will bring desolation on earth in the near future. This prophecy also talks of three legendary stones which are linked with the mentioned devastation. Fascinated, Lara travels around the globe in search of these fabled stones. Along the way she'll meet enemies both human and otherwise and will also have to deal with dark magic of sorts.

Lara is now in a "quasi-3D" overhead environment, as opposed to the 2D-platformer view of the previous handheld (GBC) versions. This view proves helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, and shoots around. Although there is lack of a save feature, there is a password system which lets you restore back to 'almost' where you left.</desc>

Yoshi will not stand for this outlandish attempt at flattening his world, and he heads off on an adventure to return things back to their original state. To help in on his quest, a group of spirits who like to surprise people give Yoshi the ability to rotate the world to his liking. The big catch with Yoshi Topsy-Turvy is its use of a motion sensor, similar to the one set to be featured in the second Wario Ware GBA game. The game cartridge includes a built in motion sensor which detects how you move the GBA system. By turning the system, you make the world rotate. A meter on the upper right corner of the screen shows which way the system is being held at any time. Rotate the system to help Yoshi stay on the path and make it past perils and through the varied stages.
Go full tilt! By tilting your Game Boy Advance, you'll tilt the environment around Yoshi, knocking over enemies, swinging pendulums, and letting Yoshi run up walls and leap huge pits! Will this ending be happy? All of Yoshi's Island is trapped in a storybook, and only by meeting the challenges of each chapter will you succeed. Collect coins, defeat enemies, or race for the finish to satisfy each course's conditions</desc>

		<name>Mega Man &amp; Bass</name>
		<desc>The story of Mega Man &amp; Bass varies slightly depending on which player character is chosen. It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.

After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his "brainwashing level" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.

Mega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were meet in the future.</desc>

		<desc>One of Mario's greatest adventures is in your hands!

Bowser and his crew of cruel Koopalings have taken over Dinosaur Island, but luckily, Mario and Luigi are up for some Koopa-kicking. As they ride Yoshi, search for P-Switches, find secret paths, blast fireballs, and soar skyward with the Cape, they'll need to use every trick in the plumber handbook. Dino Rhinos, Chargin' Chucks, and a host of unforgettable enemies await in one of the Mario Bros. biggest and most challenging adventures ever!

-All 96 levels in the palm of your hand! Ride Yoshi from the spooky Forest of Illusion to the super-tough Star Road - everything from the Super NES classic is here, powered up with all-new features for the Game Boy Advance.
-Luigi's ready, so pick a Bro and go! Now you can play as Mario or his brother, Luigi, who can jump and fly higher than his famous sibling. Which Bro is the best for each stage?
-Get linked! Using a single Game Pak, link up four players and play the timeless Mario Bros. arcade game. You can even connect with Super Mario Advance Game Paks for Multi-Pak madness!</desc>

		<desc>Wario's back for more...and more...and MORE!

Hey! You! Yeah, you! Listen up when Wario's talking to you! I just read about this legendary Pyramid of Gold, and you're gonna help me go explore it. There's lots of treasure in there for the taking, and I want it all. I'm sure there are gonna be all kinds of weird enemies and big, bad bosses in there, so if you don't think you can hack it, put the game down now. I don't want any losers making me jump into bottomless pits, you hear me?

-Wario invades the Game Boy Advance! See Wario in all his greedy glory as he explores vivid worlds made possible by the power of the GBA!
-Flex your muscles! Wario is no longer immortal, so you'll have your work cut out as you roll, punch and jump your way to tougher and tougher challenges. Wario will get stung by bees, zombified, bitten by bats, set on fire, and much more - what a way to make a living!
-Over twenty enormous stages await! Hunt down CDs for your listening pleasure, or collect treasure to spend on all-new items that you can use against the most bizarre bosses ever!</desc>
